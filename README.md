# datasets
This is a free repository for datasets generated by our system and our community. Feel free to browse through the files and download the datasets.

## A little bit about the datasets
Most of our datasets are sourced from live, up-to-date sources and offer a high level of granularity. 
We're running this repository as an experiment and (if successful) will continue growing it.
If you have any suggestions or datasets that you'd like to add, please don't hesitate to reach out to david@databar.ai.
